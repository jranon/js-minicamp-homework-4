# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions
  
  * callback functions can be passed to other functions as parameters.  This is also known as a callback pattern.  It is especially useful if your code uses the same calculations or conversions within other, different functions.
  
	* Closure
  
  * a closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.  This is especially useful if your function needs to solve something through recursion like a fibonacci sequence.
  
	* arguments array
  
  * the arguments array contains all arguments passed to a function.  However, it is not actually an array.  It is an object that is similar to an array in that its properties are numbered like an array.  
  
	* recursion
  
  * recursion is the ability to call a function from within itself.
  
	* prototype
  
  * a prototype property allows you to attach properties and methods to an object, i.e. when you want to create a constructor.
  
	* constructors
  
  * constructors are essentially custom objects that we can create when we plan to be able to create multiple instances of a certain type of object.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
